            <p>This is the box model. There are four parts to the box model.</p>
            <p>Margin: the space between the border of an element, and the border of a next element. Can be modified to space elements out on a page!
            </p>
            <img src="images/margin.png" alt="an image showing code for margins">
            <p>Border: a space between the margin of an element and the content contained. Can be given different stylings. Good to use to differentiate between different elements.</p>
            <img src="images/border.png" alt="an image showing code for borders">
            <p>Padding: a space between the border and the actual content of an element. Can be modified to give some whitespace so everything isn’t so crowded.</p>

            <h3>Create your Learning Plan</h3>
            <p><em>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</em></p>
            <p>My long term goal is to be in a job I find fulfilling and rewarding.</p>
            <p><em>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</em></p>
            <p>To be able to able to take and give criticism well. To be able to work in a team collaboratively. To manage my time and self-direction.</p>
            <p><em>A description of your own strengths and limitations</em></p>
            <p>My strengths I feel are interpersonal: I'm friendly, a team player, and I get passionate about problem solving. My limitations are: not being able to confront someone well, time-management, stress.</p>
            <p><em>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and sustainably with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</em></p>
            <p>I will commit myself to doing at least a little bit of work a day. I will plan out my time so I can complete things in a timely manner. I will make sure I take breaks when needed, and ask my peers and facilitators when I need help/hit a wall.</p>
            <p><em>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</em></p>
            <p>I won't just stew on something when I know I need to seek help. I will commit myself to reaching out on the same day that I come across a problem which I cannot solve.</p>
            <p><em>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</em></p>
            <p>Support given when needed! :)</p>
            <p><em>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</em></p>
            <p>I will block in time in the morning and evenings to get some excersie - at least half an hour each.</p>

            <h2>Sprint 1 Core Blog</h2>
            <h3>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration.</h3>
            <p>
                My core personal values are:
                </p>
                <p>
                Kindness: The ability to empathise with others; generosity; the willingness to help and improve other’s experiences when possible; to be friendly and keep the harmony
                </p>
                <p>
                Openness: A willingness to be curious and learn; to be open to change, to other people’s points of view and opinions
                </p>
                <p>
                Honesty: To be honest to myself; to be honest with others
                </p>
                <p>
                Creativity: Having my own creative/artistic vision; to always be innovating and thinking on how I can improve things
                </p>
                <p>
                A situation where I had to make an ethical decision would be when a coworker was making borderline problematic comments in the workplace. One of my personal values is honesty, but another that was in conflict was kindness in a way; I didn’t want them to feel targeted if I called them out publicly. I knew that it wasn’t right to let them keep making the comments, but my value of keeping the harmony kept me from outright pointing out what was wrong in their comments. The decision I made was to go to our manager and bring up the coworker's comments. I’m not sure what the consequences were as I left that workplace soon after, but my manager said that they were aware of the person’s comments and that action would be taken. Personally, I felt guilty that I hadn’t done more in letting the coworker know that her comments were hurtful, but I think I made the right decision in telling my manager.
                </p>
                <p>
                Personally, I don’t think that I’m particularly influenced by culture; I feel like I’m not a very cultural person, even though I do want to be more aware of the culture around me. It might just be because I’m unaware of the influences that are happening. But I feel like kiwi-culture has possibly had an impact on me—to be laidback and not overly opinionated, to be welcoming and friendly—has had an impact on how I want to be kind and open; but also had an impact on how I sometimes struggle to be honest when the truth may hurt or rock the boat.
                </p>
                <p>
                My strengths are: sensitivity, passion, creativity, a team player.
                </p>
                <p>
                My areas for development are: fluctuating self-esteem, low assertiveness, easily stressed, avoiding confrontation
                </p>
                <p>
                Again, I feel the kiwi-culture has influenced me into being a team player, but also into avoiding confrontation—we don’t like change,
                </p>
                <p>
                I feel like my strengths work well for me working collaboratively; I tend to be able to emphasise well with others, and to be able to look at things from their points of view. I like keeping harmony, and finding ways that things can work well with everyone. I’m usually passionate and curious about things that I find interesting and worth my time, and I enjoy being creative and finding ways to make things work, which I think will help me well in self motivating me on my learning journey, and help with the learning obstacles of avoiding challenges and giving up easily. However, my fear of confrontation will hold me back in pointing out things I think could be improved upon, or even asking questions that I may be unclear about. My low assertiveness ties into that as well, and my fluctuating self-esteem; I tend to doubt myself often, and sometimes take criticism personally. To have a successful career journey, I need to keep my weaknesses in mind, and actively improve upon them.
                </p>
                <p>
                When I was in my first year of high school, in one of our classes we were asked to team up with a few people and come up with a topic we all wanted to research. Everyone agreed on one topic in our group except one person, who was very passionate about wanting to research something else. I was quite young at the time, and the fact that they weren’t willing to be open to any other possibilities made me annoyed. I’m ashamed to say my strategy in dealing with this wasn’t that great; I remember saying: “if you can’t work with us, go away.” It was quite abrupt and not effective at all; the teacher ended up having to meditate and there were a lot of hurt feelings. Later I felt terrible; now I would try and communicate with her more, and ask why she was so passionate, and also try and explain our own reasoning for why we wanted to research our topic. This way she would’ve not felt so attacked, and known that her own ideas were also worthy of being researched, but that she was in a minority, and that sucked, but hopefully that she would understand our own reasoning for why we chose a certain topic.
